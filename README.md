# dictionaries_assignment
1. You will convert the list of menu items (from the lists_assignment) to a list of dictionaries.
2. The stock numbers of menu items that are not drink items is limited.  Assign the stock numbers using a random integer in the range 25 to 50 for the non-drink items.
3. Create functionality for allowing the manager to update the list of menu items - change price or description,  add an item or remove an item
4. Create functionality for taking customer requests (e.g. 30 Burger) and verifying if the item is on the menu and if the stock is large enough. Provide appropriate feedback.
5. Create the repo using your github account and submit the link to repo by 9/28/2024.  I would like to see multiple commits (3 or more) in your repo.
